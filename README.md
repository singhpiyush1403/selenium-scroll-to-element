# selenium-scroll-to-element
This project demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver with Java to scroll to a specific web element. It uses the JavascriptExecutor interface to bring the element into view on a webpage. The example navigates to calculator.net and scrolls to the "Loan Calculator" link. Includes practical usage of scrollIntoView() for dynamic page interactions.
